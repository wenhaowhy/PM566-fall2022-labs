PART 2 EDA

```{r}
# 1 Facet plot showing scatterplots with regression lines of BMI vs FEV by “townname”.

chsc %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=bmi,y=fev))  +
  geom_point(aes(color=townname))+ 
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  labs(x= "Body Mass Index", y="FEV")+
  facet_wrap(~townname)+
  ggtitle("Scatterplot of BMI vs FEV by “townname”")
 
  #Based on observations of the scatterplots we see that there is a positive relationship between BMI and FEV across different towns, which makes sense as bigger bodies in general have higher lung capacities thus forced expiratory volume.
```

```{r}
#Stacked histograms of FEV by BMI category and FEV by smoke/gas exposure. Use different color schemes than the ggplot default.

ggplot(data=chsc, aes(x=fev, fill = smoke_gas_exposure)) + geom_histogram(bins=30)+ scale_fill_brewer() #using a gradient palette

#FEV is normally distributed around 2000 for all groups smoke or gas

ggplot(data=chsc, aes(x=fev, fill = obesity_level)) + geom_histogram(bins=30)+ scale_fill_brewer() #using a gradient palette

#FEV is normally distributed around 2000 for normal, but centers around 1600 for underweight and 2200 for overweight/obese category. This makes sense given the relationship between general body size and lung volume

```

```{r}
#3 Barchart of BMI by smoke/gas exposure

ggplot(data=chsc, aes(x= smoke_gas_exposure, y=bmi)) +
  stat_summary(fun.bmi=mean, geom= "bar")+
  ggtitle("Barchart of BMI by smoke and gas exposure categories")

#average BMI appears consistently under 20 for the 5 groups of smoke vs gas exposure.  BMI appears lowest in the group that was subject to neither smoke or gas.
```


4 Statistical summary graph of bmi with fev


```{r}
 chsc[!is.na(chsc$fev),] %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = obesity_level, y = fev)) + 
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_sdl, geom = "pointrange") +
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_sdl, geom = "errorbar") 
```


4 Statistical summary graph of smoke gas exposure with fev

```{r}
  chsc[!is.na(chsc$fev),] %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = smoke_gas_exposure, y = fev)) + 
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_sdl, geom = "pointrange") +
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_sdl, geom = "errorbar") 
```

function would not run for some reason : object 'fev' not found
  

```{r}
#5 A leaflet map showing the concentrations of PM2.5 mass in each of the CHS communities.
pm25.pal <- colorNumeric(c('yellow','red'), domain=chsc$pm25_mass)


leaflet(chsc) %>% 
  addProviderTiles('CartoDB.Positron') %>% 
  addCircles(
    lat = ~lat, lng=~lon,
    opacity = 1, fillOpacity = 1, radius = 500, color = ~pm25.pal(pm25_mass)
    ) %>%
  addLegend("bottomright", pal = pm25.pal, values = ~pm25_mass,
    title = "PM2.5 Concentrations",
    opacity = 1
  )
# Keep the legend title short to not overwrite map
```

The leaflet maps show a higher concentration of pm2.5 particles closer to riverside and a lower concentration outside of the LA metropolitan area and closer to the coast. This is likely the result of pollution and trapping of particles within the central basins.

```{r}
#6 Choose a visualization to examine whether PM2.5 mass is associated with FEV.

chsc %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=pm25_mass,y=fev)) +
  geom_point()+labs(x= "pm2.5 mass", y="FEV")+ geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("Associations between PM2.5 mass and FEV")

#unsure about how to insert a regression equation, but based on observation and the regression line alone, there seems to be a negative association between pm2.5 mass and FEV.  The relationship however appears very small. 
```
